              <p>
                Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in the film industry has been shaped by societal movements, industry changes, and global trends. Despite these developments, the industry remains male-dominated, and women continue to be significantly underrepresented in the filmmaking workforce.
                </p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Problem</span></li>
              <p>
                Women directors remain significantly underrepresented in the film industry, particularly in mainstream, high-budget productions. Also Independent films are often overlooked in favor of mainstream productions, yet they play a critical role in enabling diverse voices, including women and marginalized groups.
                </p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Our Goal</span></li>
            
            <p>
               To discover trends in the role of female directors in cinema by analyzing their activity across different countries and examining movie databases for specific periods of study. This will include exploring the role of independent cinema as a pathway for women directors. The research will uncover patterns of representation, contributions, and shifts over time.

            <h3>Research question 1. How has the number of women directors in feature films changed over the last 30 years </h3>
          <div>
            <iframe src="charts/number_of_films_chart_rq1.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          </div> 


            <p>The data confirms a steady upward trend in the number of feature films directed by women worldwide, with 2016 being a standout year, recording 1,448 films, compared to the lowest point in 1994, with just 224 films. This demonstrates that more women have been entering and establishing themselves in the filmmaking industry.

              In addition to tracking the overall number of films directed by women, an analysis of genres reveals interesting trends: 2016 saw a notable rise in the popularity of documentaries directed by women 
                 </p>
                 <div>
                  <iframe src="charts/top_genres_rq1.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                
            <p>Documentaries often have lower production costs and fewer barriers to entry, potentially making them a more accessible genre for women directors. This highlights the structural challenges in more resource-intensive genres, such as action or large-scale dramas. This shift suggests that documentaries may serve as a more accessible or favorable entry point for female directors, enabling greater representation in this genre. </p>

              <h3>Research question 2. Which countries have the highest and lowest numbers of women directors ? </h3>
              <div>
                <iframe src="charts/map_rq2.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
              </div>
              <p>
                To illustrate the global distribution of women directors in feature films, we created an interactive map using Plotly. The data reveals that the United States leads with the largest number of female directors, reflecting the highest representation worldwide. In contrast, many countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still demonstrate minimal female representation. This significant disparity highlights deeper structural challenges that vary across regions.    </p>
               <p> One key factor contributing to underrepresentation in areas such as Africa and Southeast Asia is the presence of cultural barriers, limited funding opportunities, and restricted access to education in filmmaking. These obstacles hinder women from pursuing or sustaining careers as directors in these regions. Additionally, the lack of accessible data and research in these areas compounds the difficulty in identifying trends and addressing systemic issues, especially in niches such as independent cinema.  </p>
                <p> Such countirs as Yemen, Cambodia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Moldova, and Kazakhstan as having minimal female representation in film directing. While progress has been made in certain regions, the persistent underrepresentation in these countries reflects systemic inequities that demand global attention and intervention.

                <div>
                  <iframe src="charts/pie_chart_rq2.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we created a pie chart to show the proportional share of women directors by country.  The United States shows its leading position.</p>
                <p>These results underscore the uneven progress in gender representation worldwide. While some regions have made strides through targeted policies and cultural shifts, others continue to face significant challenges. Achieving meaningful gender equity in feature film directing requires global collaboration, stronger support systems for women filmmakers, and a commitment to breaking down cultural and institutional barriers.</p>

                <h3>Research question 3
                  What is the ratio of awards won to nominations across years for female directors?
                   </h3>
                   <div>

                <p>
                  Both nominations (orange) and awards (blue) show a consistent increase over the years, with significant growth after 2010. This reflects a gradual rise in the recognition of female directors. Across all years, nominations far outnumber awards, indicating that while female directors are gaining visibility, the proportion of nominations that result in awards remains relatively low. There is a clear peak in nominations around 2019, followed by a slight decline in the subsequent years. Awards also show a similar trend, although the peak appears less pronounced.Despite some fluctuations, the awards-to-nominations ratio seems relatively stable. However, the absolute numbers indicate that female directors are receiving more recognition compared to earlier decades.</p>

    <!-- conclusion -->

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Both the documentary genre and independent filmmaking appear to offer greater opportunities for diverse voices, including female directors, to enter and thrive in the film industry. The year 2016 stands out as a leader for both documentary production and independent film creation, indicating a significant shift toward alternative genres and non-mainstream film production</p>
              <p>The United States has the highest representation of women directors, while a significant number of countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still show minimal female representation. This disparity is also reflected in the availability of data and research. While the United States and European countries benefit from more accessible data and well-documented research, information from Asian and African countries remains limited.
                </p>
                <p>Scholars further lack insights into trends and patterns across different regions and types of film production, such as independent cinema.
                </p>
                <p>Countries like Yemen, Cambodia, and Mozambique rank at the bottom, highlighting regions with minimal female representation. The proportional breakdown reveals that even among leading countries, women directors remain underrepresented globally. These results emphasize both the progress made in certain regions and the ongoing challenges in achieving gender equality in feature film directing worldwide.</p>
                <p>Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in feature films has been influenced by societal movements, industry shifts, and global trends. While some progress has been made, representation varies significantly by year and country. Independent cinema often provides more opportunities for women compared to blockbuster productions, highlighting barriers in mainstream filmmaking. Examining global trends, including the rise of women directors in certain countries and their correlation with industry characteristics, sheds light on systemic challenges and opportunities for greater gender equity in the film industry.</p>
