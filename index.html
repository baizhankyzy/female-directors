              <p>
                Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in the film industry has been shaped by societal movements, industry changes, and global trends. Despite these developments, the industry remains male-dominated, and women continue to be significantly underrepresented in the filmmaking workforce.
                </p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Problem</span></li>
              <p>
                Women directors remain significantly underrepresented in the film industry, particularly in mainstream, high-budget productions. Also Independent films are often overlooked in favor of mainstream productions, yet they play a critical role in enabling diverse voices, including women and marginalized groups.
                </p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Our Goal</span></li>
            
            <p>
               To discover trends in the role of female directors in cinema by analyzing their activity across different countries and examining movie databases for specific periods of study. This will include exploring the role of independent cinema as a pathway for women directors. The research will uncover patterns of representation, contributions, and shifts over time.

              <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
              <p>We examined the data models of Wikidata and DBpedia regarding female directors, films, genres, and release dates.</p>
              <p>Data Collection: Release dates, the number of films directed by women, countries, and the number of women directors were collected from Wikidata and DBpedia. We queried both Wikidata and DBpedia SPARQL endpoints, reconciled the data, and removed duplicates. Despite this process, the final dataset was significantly reduced, resulting in only 109 matches by director labels (e.g., Lana Wachowski). This reduction contrasts with the fact that Wikidata alone lists 10,342 female directors!
                DBpedia Issues: DBpedia presents challenges with gender identity. While it uses the RDF label "female director", many entries for the gender property remain unknown or unpopulated. As a result, DBpedia cannot be relied upon for fully reconciling data with Wikidata due to its significant lack of information.
                IMDb Limitations: IMDb does not provide comprehensive film data. It offers subsets of its database for personal and non-commercial use, but these subsets are limited. The broadest available datasets only include: titleType (string), startYear (YYYY), runtimeMinutes, genres (string array).
                This limitation prevents access to complete information about films directed by women, further constraining the analysis.
                </p>
                <p>The Europeana Data Model (EDM) does not include a specific property to denote the gender of creators, such as schema:gender. The EDM primarily focuses on properties like dc:creator to identify the creator of a cultural heritage object, without detailing attributes like gender. This is evident in the EDM Mapping Guidelines, which outline the properties and classes used within the model. The guidelines detail various metadata elements but do not specify a property for capturing the gender of creators. Additionally, the EDM documentation available on Europeana’s professional portal provides comprehensive information about the model’s structure and elements. A review of these resources confirms the absence of a gender-specific property for creators. Therefore, while EDM facilitates the integration and sharing of cultural heritage metadata across Europe, it currently lacks provisions for recording the gender of creators within its standard schema.

            <h3>Research question 1. How has the number of women directors in feature films changed over the last 30 years </h3>
            <p>
              To illustrate the changes over time, we present a bar chart with the x-axis representing the "year" and the y-axis representing the "number of films" directed by women.

              The data reveals a general upward trend in the number of feature films directed by women over the past three decades all around the world, indicating increasing participation of women in the film industry. The highest point was recorded in 2016, with 1,448 films directed by women, while the lowest point occurred in 1994, with just 224 films.
              However, recent years show a notable decline, with 2024 displaying a significant drop in numbers. This trend highlights both the progress made in empowering women directors and the ongoing challenges they face in achieving consistent and sustainable representation within the industry.            </p>

              <h3>Research question 2. Which countries have the highest and lowest numbers of women directors ? </h3>
              <p>
                To illustrate which countries have the highest and lowest numbers of women directors in feature films, we developed an interactive map using Plotly (picture 1). The map is interactive on Google Colab notebook</p>
  
               <p> Additionally, we created two horizontal bar charts:
The first bar chart (pic.2) visualizes the top 10 countries by the number of women directors. The x-axis represents the number of women directors, while the y-axis lists the countries. The United States has the largest number of female directors, whereas Russia ranks 10th.
The second bar chart (pic.3) highlights the countries with the smallest number of female directors, sorted from smallest to largest. These countries include Yemen, Cambodia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Moldova, and Kazakhstan, demonstrating that many countries have minimal female representation in film directing. </p>
                <p>Finally, we created a pie chart (pic.4) to show the proportional share of women directors by country. The chart focuses on the top 20 countries and displays the percentage contribution of each country. The United States accounts for 20.08% of the total share, showcasing its leading position. </p>

                <h3>Research question 3
                  What is the relationship between independent cinema and the rise of women directors in cinema industry?
                   </h3>
                <p>
                  Based on the previously extracted data, we decided to analyze independent cinema specifically in the USA.
                  To classify films, we mapped movies directed by women to their distributors. Films produced with major distributors (e.g., Disney, Warner Bros., Universal) were categorized as "studio-produced", while those without major distributors were classified as "independent".
                  To illustrate the findings, we used a line chart.</p>

                  <p>A notable trend in 2016 was the rise of independent films, with 224 independent movies produced without major distributors such as Disney, Universal, or Warner Bros. This large number highlights the growing presence of independent female filmmakers, who often operate outside mainstream production systems.
                    Additionally, 2016 marked a significant increase in the popularity of the documentary genre. This shift suggests that documentaries may serve as a more accessible or favorable entry point for female directors, enabling greater representation in this genre.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="row justify-content-center" data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-delay="100">

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>Both the documentary genre and independent filmmaking appear to offer greater opportunities for diverse voices, including female directors, to enter and thrive in the film industry. The year 2016 stands out as a leader for both documentary production and independent film creation, indicating a significant shift toward alternative genres and non-mainstream film production</p>
              <p>The United States has the highest representation of women directors, while a significant number of countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still show minimal female representation. This disparity is also reflected in the availability of data and research. While the United States and European countries benefit from more accessible data and well-documented research, information from Asian and African countries remains limited.
                </p>
                <p>Scholars further lack insights into trends and patterns across different regions and types of film production, such as independent cinema.
                </p>
                <p>Countries like Yemen, Cambodia, and Mozambique rank at the bottom, highlighting regions with minimal female representation. The proportional breakdown reveals that even among leading countries, women directors remain underrepresented globally. These results emphasize both the progress made in certain regions and the ongoing challenges in achieving gender equality in feature film directing worldwide.</p>
                <p>Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in feature films has been influenced by societal movements, industry shifts, and global trends. While some progress has been made, representation varies significantly by year and country. Independent cinema often provides more opportunities for women compared to blockbuster productions, highlighting barriers in mainstream filmmaking. Examining global trends, including the rise of women directors in certain countries and their correlation with industry characteristics, sheds light on systemic challenges and opportunities for greater gender equity in the film industry.</p>
