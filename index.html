              <p>
                Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in the film industry has been shaped by societal movements, industry changes, and global trends. Despite these developments, the industry remains male-dominated, and women continue to be significantly underrepresented in the filmmaking workforce.              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Problem</span></li>
              <p>
                Women directors remain significantly underrepresented in the film industry, particularly in mainstream, high-budget productions.
                </p>
              <li><i class="bi bi-check2-all"></i> <span>Our Goal</span></li>
            
            <p>
              To discover trends in the role of female directors in cinema by analyzing their activity across different countries and examining movie databases for specific periods of study. The research will uncover patterns of representation, contributions, and shifts over time.            </p>

            <h3>Research question 1. How has the number of women directors in feature films changed over the last 30 years </h3>
          <div>
            <iframe src="charts/number_of_films_chart_rq1.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
          </div>
          </div> 


            <p>The data confirms a steady upward trend in the number of feature films directed by women worldwide, with 2016 being a standout year, recording 1,448 films, compared to the lowest point in 1994, with just 224 films. This demonstrates that more women have been entering and establishing themselves in the filmmaking industry.

              In addition to tracking the overall number of films directed by women, an analysis of genres reveals interesting trends: 2016 saw a notable rise in the popularity of documentaries directed by women 
                 </p>
                 <div>
                  <iframe src="charts/top_genres_rq1.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                
            <p>Our findings revealed a significant rise in the popularity of the documentary genre in 2016. Documentaries often have lower production costs and fewer barriers to entry, making them a more accessible option for women directors.
              This trend underscores how documentaries may serve as an entry point for female directors, offering greater opportunities for representation and creative expression within the industry. However, it also draws attention to the need for reducing barriers and increasing access for women in higher-budget genres to achieve broader gender equity across the film industry.</p>

              <p></p>
              <h3>Research question 2. Which countries have the highest and lowest numbers of women directors? </h3>
              <div>
                <iframe src="charts/map_rq2.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
              </div>
              <p>
                The data reveals that the United States leads with the largest number of female directors, reflecting the highest representation worldwide. In contrast, many countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still demonstrate minimal female representation. This significant disparity highlights deeper structural challenges that vary across regions.    </p>
               <p> One key factor contributing to underrepresentation in areas such as Africa and Southeast Asia is the presence of cultural barriers, limited funding opportunities, and restricted access to education in filmmaking. These obstacles hinder women from pursuing or sustaining careers as directors in these regions. Additionally, the lack of accessible data and research in these areas compounds the difficulty in identifying trends and addressing systemic issues.  </p>
                <p> Such countirs as Yemen, Cambodia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Moldova, and Kazakhstan as having minimal female representation in film directing. While progress has been made in certain regions, the persistent underrepresentation in these countries reflects systemic inequities that demand global attention and intervention.

                </div>
                <p>The chart highlights the percentage representation of each country, with the United States accounting for 14.4% of the total share, demonstrating its leading position in terms of female directors. Germany follows with 10.9%, and France ranks third with 7.33%. Other countries, each contributing smaller percentages, collectively account for 28%, illustrating the global diversity of representation.
                  
                  </p>
                <p>This chart helps to showcase the significant contribution of leading countries while also emphasizing the need for broader representation and support for women directors in other regions. It offers a clear picture of the disparities between dominant countries and those with fewer directors, as well as the overall global distribution.</p>

                  What is the ratio of awards won to nominations across years for female directors?

                </div>
                <p>The stacked bar chart shows a clear upward trend in both nominations (orange) and awards (blue) received by female directors from 1994 to 2024. There is a steady increase in the total number of nominations and awards over time, reflecting an expansion in award ceremonies or recognition of more works. The blue section (awards) grows proportionally with the orange section (nominations), suggesting a consistent win rate over the years. However, in recent years, particularly after 2020, the total number of nominations and awards appears to decline. The highest levels of nominations and awards are observed in the years between 2015 and 2019. This could indicate a particularly active period for awards.
                  From 2020 onwards, there’s a noticeable drop in both nominations and wins. This may be attributed to the global pandemic, which impacted film productions and ceremonies. </p>
                
                  <p>In summary, the chart reveals significant growth in awards and nominations over time, peaking around 2015–2019, followed by a decline after 2020.

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p>The United States has the highest representation of women directors, while a significant number of countries—particularly in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia—still show minimal female representation. This disparity is also reflected in the availability of data and research. While the United States and European countries benefit from more accessible data and well-documented research, information from Asian and African countries remains limited.  Also factors such as cultural barriers, lack of funding, and limited access to filmmaking education likely contribute to the low representation of female directors in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
              <p> Documentaries became notably popular in 2016, likely due to their lower production costs and structural accessibility, making them a favorable genre for female filmmakers.Analyzing this year alongside 2015 and 2017 revealed a growing trend in independent filmmaking and documentary production, indicating that female directors are finding their voice and opportunities in these areas. This trend  indicates a significant shift toward alternative genres and non-mainstream film production. 
                </p>
                <p>Both nominations and awards for female directors have shown consistent growth, with significant increases after 2010. However, nominations still far exceed awards, reflecting the ongoing struggle for women directors to convert recognition into wins.
                </p>
               
                <p>Over the past 30 years, the representation of women directors in feature films has been influenced by societal movements, industry shifts, and global trends. While some progress has been made, representation varies significantly by year and country.Documantary cinema often provides more opportunities for women compared to blockbuster productions, highlighting barriers in mainstream filmmaking. Examining global trends, including the rise of women directors in certain countries and their correlation with industry characteristics, sheds light on systemic challenges and opportunities for greater gender equity in the film industry.</p>
